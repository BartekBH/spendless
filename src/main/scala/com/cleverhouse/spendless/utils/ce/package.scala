  /** Starts an (untyped) Akka actor system in the
   * context of a Cats-Effect `Resource`, and integrating
   * with its cancellation abilities.
   *
   * HINT: for apps (in `main`), it's best if
   * `akka.coordinated-shutdown.exit-jvm` is set to `on`,
   * because Akka can decide to shutdown on its own. And
   * having this setting interacts well with Cats-Effect.
   *
   * @param systemName                  is the identifying name of the system.
   * @param config                      is an optional, parsed HOCON configuration;
   *                                    if None, then Akka will read its own, possibly
   *                                    from `application.conf`; this parameter is
   *                                    provided in order to control the source of
   *                                    the application's configuration.
   * @param useIOExecutionContext       if true, then Cats-Effect's
   *                                    default thread-pool will get used by Akka, as well.
   *                                    This is needed in order to avoid having too many
   *                                    thread-pools.
   * @param timeoutAwaitCatsEffect      is the maximum amount of time
   *                                    Akka's coordinated-shutdown is allowed to wait for
   *                                    Cats-Effect to finish. This is needed, as Cats-Effect
   *                                    could have a faulty stack of disposables, or because
   *                                    Akka could decide to shutdown on its own.
   * @param timeoutAwaitAkkaTermination is the maximum amount of
   *                                    time to wait for the actor system to terminate, after
   *                                    `terminate()` was called. We need the timeout, because
   *                                    `terminate()` proved to return a `Future` that never
   *                                    completes in certain scenarios (could be a bug, or a
   *                                    race condition).
